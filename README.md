# Reference Conflicts Analyzer - Visual Studio Extension

This is a tool (this is a draft now; will be an extension to Visual Studio) for convinient analysis of the "Could not load file or assembly or one of its dependencies" problem. The tool allows selecting an .Net assembly (.ddl or .exe file) and get a graph of all referenced assemblies with hightlighted confliting references. 

After installation it will be available in the main menu: Tools -&gt; Reference Conflicts Analyzer.
